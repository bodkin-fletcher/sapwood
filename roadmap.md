# Sapwood Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the major development steps required to transform the current barebones application into a fully functional, production-ready app that meets all requirements specified in the scope document. The roadmap is designed with an MVP-first approach, delivering usable functionality early and iteratively adding features.

## 1. MVP Foundation: Basic Node Management (Sprint 1)

**Usable Functionality:** Create, visualize, and configure simple nodes in a static layout

- Set up essential state management with Context API
- Implement basic routing for primary views (Node Display, Settings)
- Create the SVG-based hexagon node rendering system
- Implement simple node creation and configuration interface
- Add basic in-memory data persistence
- Establish API service layer for node operations
- Develop basic settings page with configuration options

**MVP Milestone:** Users can create nodes, configure basic properties, and save their configuration.

## 2. Connection & Visualization Enhancement (Sprint 2)

**Usable Functionality:** Connect nodes and visualize relationships in an interactive canvas

- Implement node connection visualization with SVG paths
- Add drag-and-drop functionality for node placement
- Develop node selection and focus system with right panel details
- Create connection management system (creating, editing, deleting)
- Add basic color-coded status indicators
- Implement simple heartbeat check mechanism for nodes

**Milestone:** Users can create full node graphs with connections and see basic status information.

## 3. Basic Data Wrangling Capabilities (Sprint 3)

**Usable Functionality:** View and edit data flowing between nodes

- Build simple data visualization for common formats (JSON, CSV)
- Implement basic data transformation tools
- Create tabular data viewer/editor for simple edits
- Add file-based JSON persistence for nodes and configurations
- Develop data flow inspection tools to see inputs/outputs
- Implement simple data validation

**Milestone:** Users can inspect, modify, and manage data flowing between nodes.

## 4. API Integration & Enhanced Monitoring (Sprint 4)

**Usable Functionality:** Connect to external services and monitor node health

- Enhance node health check system with configurable intervals
- Implement more robust API client capabilities
- Add real-time status updates
- Create monitoring dashboard with basic metrics
- Implement retry mechanisms for node connections
- Add data history for recent operations

**Milestone:** Users can reliably connect to external services and monitor system health.

## 5. Layout & Export Capabilities (Sprint 5)

**Usable Functionality:** Generate visual layouts and export data

- Create SVG-based layout editor sized for paper output
- Implement export capabilities (SVG, PDF)
- Add print layout preview functionality
- Enhance data export options (JSON, CSV)
- Implement simple template system for layouts
- Add node grouping functionality for organization

**Milestone:** Users can generate professional layouts and export both data and visualizations.

## 6. Advanced Data Processing (Sprint 6)

**Usable Functionality:** Process complex data with transformations and automation

- Enhance data transformation tools with more functions
- Add support for additional formats (YAML, Markdown)
- Implement bulk editing capabilities for data sets
- Create more sophisticated data validation rules
- Develop automated data processing workflows
- Add data format conversion utilities

**Milestone:** Users can handle complex data transformation requirements.

## 7. User Management & Security (Sprint 7)

**Usable Functionality:** Multi-user support with basic security

- Implement simple user authentication system
- Create user management interface
- Add basic role-based access control
- Implement session management
- Enhance data security and permissions
- Add audit logging for important operations

**Milestone:** Multiple users can access the system with appropriate permissions.

## 8. Performance & Scalability (Sprint 8)

**Usable Functionality:** Handle larger node graphs and datasets efficiently

- Optimize rendering for large node graphs
- Enhance data handling for larger datasets
- Implement pagination and virtualization for lists
- Add performance profiling and optimizations
- Improve system responsiveness under load
- Implement smarter data fetching strategies

**Milestone:** System performs well with large, complex node configurations.

## 9. DevOps & Deployment (Sprint 9)

**Usable Functionality:** Easy deployment and operation in production

- Create Docker containerization
- Implement CI/CD pipeline
- Add environment configuration management
- Develop automated backup strategies
- Create monitoring and alerting for production
- Add installation and upgrade utilities

**Milestone:** System can be reliably deployed and operated in production environments.

## 10. Documentation & Final Polish (Sprint 10)

**Usable Functionality:** Complete product with good usability and documentation

- Complete user documentation with tutorials
- Create onboarding experience and guided tours
- Add keyboard shortcuts and productivity enhancements
- Final UI/UX improvements
- Implement accessibility enhancements
- Conduct security audit and address findings

**Milestone:** Product is fully documented, polished, and ready for wide adoption.

## Timeline & Milestones

Based on two-week sprints, this roadmap represents approximately 5-6 months of development:

- **MVP (End of Sprint 1)**: Basic node creation and configuration
- **Enhanced MVP (End of Sprint 3)**: Full node graphs with data wrangling
- **Feature Complete (End of Sprint 7)**: All core functionality implemented
- **Production Ready (End of Sprint 10)**: Fully polished, deployed system

This timeline assumes a team of 2-4 developers working concurrently. Each milestone delivers independently valuable functionality that users can immediately put to work.
